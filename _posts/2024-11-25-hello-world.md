## Intro

Welcome to my blog! I took quite a long hiatus, but I thought it'd be a good idea to revive this website. I built this blog a few yeares ago using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) combined with the [YAT theme](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat), hosted on GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a simple and performant static site generator that is built around Markdown, which makes it perfect for blogging.

Of course, you can't blog without something to blog about. I expect to write a few different types of posts:

1. **Project Showcases**: Posts demonstrating complete projects. Hopefully I can finish some in the next month (okay, year) so this blog can be populated.
2. **Devlogs**: Posts following the development of a project, both to keep me accountable and as something to look back on and learn from.
3. **Thought Clarifications**: Posts turning my most important thoughts into writing. Since after all:

## Features Showcase

This Jekyll-powered blog (using the YAT theme) supports a variety of features, which I've also customized a bit. Here are a few:

### Code Highlighting

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple function to greet the world."""
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)
    return message

# Call the function
hello_world()
```

### $LaTeX$ Rendering

The blog supports $LaTeX$ rendering for mathematical expressions. A more complex example:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u $$

### Blockquotes and Formatting

> "The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe." — Gustave Flaubert

You can also use **bold text**, _italics_, and ~~strikethrough~~ for emphasis.

### Lists and Tables

| Feature           | Description                  | Supported |

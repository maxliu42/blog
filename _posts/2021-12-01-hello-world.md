The most important question: Why?

It's the first post, so I'll take the opportunity to examine *why* I wanted to make this website in the
first place. Then I'll determine *what* kind of posts I want to make.

## Why Blog?

The main feature of this personal website is this blog. So why blog? Well, there are a few reasons.

### Writing is Remembering!

Writing isn't much fun, but it gives you an extension of your own memory. That's incredibly valuable, even without any
readership. I didn't start this blog with the purpose of popularity, I started it with the purpose of writing down
things that are meaningful to *me*. I'd like to remember those things.

Of course, I didn't need to start a public blog for that. But I wanted to carve out a space on the internet for my
website because--

### It's a Portfolio!

Sure, this website isn't as flashy as most personal portfolio websites. Still, it gives a comprehensive view of who I am and what I do.
The convenience of having one place with all of my social media links is great. If anyone asks me what I'm up to, I can just link them here,
a website that'll contain my interests and personal thoughts, but also my more serious projects.

So if the point of the website is also to detail my projects, then I'd better hope that--

### Devlogs are Fun!

Keeping a devlog is a fun way to look back on my progress and my (inevitable) mistakes and misconceptions. It's also
a great way to stay motivated!

What's a devlog? It's a popular abbreviation in game development communities for "developer log", a blog detailing the progress of a game.
Games are especially fun to follow since they're highly visual, but devlogs can be made for all sorts of projects. Popular indie game hosting site
[itch.io](https://itch.io){:target="_blank"} has a whole section dedicated to [devlogs](https://itch.io/devlogs){:target="_blank"}, which I find endlessly
inspiring.

## About What?

But to start a devlog, you have to actually *do* stuff. Aah! That's my weakness! Luckily, I have plenty of interests to
explore, such as--

### CS/Math

I know, very broad. I'm interested in many topics within computer science, from [competitive programming](https://dmoj.ca/user/parhelic){:target="_blank"} to [game development](https://maxliu42.itch.io){:target="_blank"} to digital audio. I'm also an executive of my school's [computer science club](https://github.com/WoodlandsComputerScience/MeetingContent){:target="_blank"}, which regularly covers topics from Discord bots to web development to cryptography.

<div align="center"><em>Yes, I made a platformer game called "FATHEAD".</em></div><br/><br/>
The fields I'd really like to research more into are **game development** and **digital audio**. To be honest, I still
consider myself a beginner in both fields. But hey, it's never too late to learn.

### Music

Both listening and producing! I listen to way too many genres to give a good overview in this blog post, nor would it be
necessary to, but I'm especially interested in electronic music right now. I've been producing electronic music using [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/){:target="_blank"} since 2016.

I release all of my music under the name **wetua**, which you can find on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2pnojOyO32Samtd33yJNtg){:target="_blank"}, but also on all major streaming services including [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/69brelfuAcFaL4tByp6Xso){:target="_blank"} and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/wetua/1453577210){:target="_blank"}. I've released three albums: Wetua Vol. 1, Dead Worlds, and Everchanging. I also released two EPs this year, State of Mind and 2842. It's a lot of music. Is it any good? I don't know. But I'd appreciate any feedback.

Of course, there's also a lovely overlap between electronic music, mathematics, and computer science. To quote Boards of
Canada: ["Music is Math"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhPWJHrwgR4){:target="_blank"}. I have some plans in my head for related projects--but
that'll come a bit later.

### Thoughts

This isn't a business blog. It's a personal website, so I don't want to force myself into any artificial restrictions.
I'm a regular person--that is, I have opinions. I think there's a lot about the world worth writing about. So yes, sometimes I'll have some random thoughts to share.

Part of the reason I started a blog is to write about what's meaningful to *me*. Every once in a while I'll want to make a post
that doesn't quite fit into everything else, and that's okay. It might be irrelevant to everything else on the site, but I don't have a problem with that.

## Blog Design

That pretty much covers *what* this blog is about. But *how* was this blog built?

### Jekyll

First, I wanted a simple way to get a static site running. I looked at several options, but services like WordPress
or website builders like Wix or Squarespace seemed restrictive to me, not to mention costly. I landed on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"} as a beautifully simple and apt solution for all my problems. The ability to write posts in Markdown is nice. Even better is the wealth of themes available, including the theme this website is currently using--

### Yet Another YAT Theme!

This [excellent theme](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat){:target="_blank"} by [Jeffrey Tse](https://github.com/jeffreytse){:target="_blank"}
is the basis for the site, and I give him my sincere thanks for publishing it. It's clean, unobtrusive, and has plenty of
quality of life features such as a theme switcher and a table of contents.

I edited a few things to preference like font family/size, padding, and various heights and widths. But mostly I was thankful to be able to focus on the content rather of the design because of this great theme.

### What Now?

This first post is just that, the first one. Stay tuned for all sorts of posts. I'm not giving myself any schedule, but
I'd like to update this blog on at least a weekly basis, at least for a little while.

The first series of posts I'll start is a series of **retrospective** posts, in which I'll detail the process of developing my previous games, stretching back over five years. Then hopefully I'll have some ideas for future projects too.

You can't spend all of your time looking back, nor can you spend all your time dreaming of the future without any
self-reflection. Life is about finding that balance and figuring out what keeps *you* going. I'll leave this off with a quote from Regina Spektor's
[Consequence of Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_01Arv5hkIc){:target="_blank"}:

> Just 'cause one song is done<br>
There's always another one<br>
Waiting right around the bend<br>
Till this one ends<br>
Then it begins<br>
Squeaky clean, and it starts all over again

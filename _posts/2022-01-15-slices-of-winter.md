Snow day after snow day has given me the inspiration to dig out the old camera and take a few photos. There's a lot of beauty to be found every day. So let's look at it. Here's eight photos I took on a regular afternoon walk to the park, trying to capture the everyday beauty of winter.

It's best if you view this on the largest device you have. You can click on each "slice" to view the full image---I recommend looking at each slice first, then clicking through each one. The full image is *uncompressed*, so it might take a while to load. Though you can zoom in and do all sorts of fancy stuff---Thank [Fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/docs/ui/fancybox/){:target="_blank"} for that.

Now this way-too-long winter can live on forever through these photos. As I pray for warmer weather, hopefully this post will give me something to look back on. But most of all, I can't wait for "Slices of Spring", whatever it may bring.

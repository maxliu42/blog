On New Year's Day we turn the page--only to find the sentence spilled over, a seamless transition.

The practical side of me recognizes the new year as nothing more than an arbitrary date. New Year's and the accompanying resolutions sell a fantasy of extravagant change, but it's no secret that most people fail. You can't restructure your whole life in one day, so why bother celebrating? Life is continuous, causal, each day equally important, each moment melting into the next. 

Yet it's precisely *because* of life's seamlessness that we *have* to celebrate New Year's Day. This is a rare chance to mentally reflect and reset. There is no way *not* to celebrate. Sure, it's just another day, but that doesn't explain my giddiness naming this blog post "2022-01-01". During quarantine, we've faced large blocks of time, months on end staying in the same rooms, going through the same motions. It's liquefied the structure of our lives, distorting the passage of time. Near the start of the pandemic we all had moments delighting in the extra time off. But as months turned to years, the alluring pauses transformed into imposing, suffocating swaths of time--perpetual, *seamless*.

That's why for the first time in my life I felt not just inspired to set a resolution, but almost compelled to. Anything that breaks up the monotony of COVID-era life is a real positive. Let's be real here--life's been a lot to handle lately. For the first time I'm *glad* to see the date change, in a way that the previous, pragmatic me never understood.

So what's my resolution? Well, I'm a big fan of CGP Grey and his excellent video [Your Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE). The flexibility of having a single-word "theme" for a year is appealing, yet simultaneously dangerous. On one hand, the pandemic taught us the importance of adaptability, with a theme being more widely applicable than a rigid resolution. If I declare 2022 the "Year of Health", then that's something that can influence all my decision-making, and doesn't require any specific conditions like gyms or stores being open. But themes are vague. A lack of specific goals makes measuring progress near impossible, so it's clear that both are necessary.

My theme for 2022 is the "Year of Structure". That's the word that grabs me, the word that drags me by the collar and forces me to rethink the way I live my life. It's easy to let good habits slip away during quarantine. Long days of unorganized, floating ideas, an endless perpetuity juxtaposed with a lack of enjoyable routine. I need to restore what the pandemic took from us--structure.

My winter break is coming to an end, and it's unclear exactly what I've accomplished. Days slid by, melting into one another, as broken promises of productivity sank to tomorrow. I'm better at managing these feelings than ever, and I can say that I *have* done a lot over winter break. But I'm not satisfied with it. New Year's Day might be arbitrary, but it's as good a day as any other to reshape my life one step at a time.

Along with this theme I've set myself the main goal of exercising. Yes, it's simple, but at the same time fundamentally important to living a good life. I've made specific plans for it, along with a few other habits I'd like to codify. But I'll do it gradually. Building one good habit is hard enough.

Hopefully you made it through 2021 without too much stress. Here's to a new year, and let's hope for some good news in 2022--we're gonna need it!

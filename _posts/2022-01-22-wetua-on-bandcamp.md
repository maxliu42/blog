The full Wetua discography is now on [Bandcamp](https://wetua.bandcamp.com/){:target="_blank"}! It's been on streaming services for a while now, but Bandcamp is an excellent, artist-friendly platform that I really should've gotten on earlier. It's also great for listeners, too---the features are refreshing and point toward a healthy future for indie music. [My first album](https://wetua.bandcamp.com/album/wetua-vol-1){:target="_blank"} is available as pay-what-you-want. Feel free to grab it... for free!

Although if you want an introduction to my music, this techno EP might be more representative:

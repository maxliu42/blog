I have a new subdomain, [https://p4.maxliu.me/](https://p4.maxliu.me/){:target="_blank"}, for physics related content. As with this blog, the first post is all you need to read to understand what it's about. It's a research and brainstorming log for a school project I'm working on, termed the **P**andemic **P**hysics **P**ersonal **P**roject---or **P4** for short. My main idea at the moment is to research plate reverb, since it has a beautiful distinctive sound that might be explainable through physics.

The school project requires a website. Luckily, I already have one! I'm hosting this on a subdomain since the content isn't particularly appropriate for the main site because of how specialized it is. The subdomain will eventually hae plenty of blog posts of its own, likely all related to reverb or sound design. That's all! Take a look at the site, if you're interested.

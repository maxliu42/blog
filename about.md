Hi! I'm Max, a Canadian Grade 12 student. My main interests are computer science, math, electronic music production, and video games. On this site I blog about anything I find important, thought-provoking, or meaningful. Some of my other hobbies include running and playing guitar.

This blog *[doesn't have a specific focus](/meta/2021/12/01/hello-world.html){:target="_blank"}*. Check out the
[Categories](categories.html){:target="_blank"}  and [Tags](tags.html){:target="_blank"}  for the content you want to see!\
And thanks for visiting my website :)
